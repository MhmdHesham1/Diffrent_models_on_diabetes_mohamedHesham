Different Models on Diabetes - Mohamed Hesham
Project Overview

This project involves the development and comparison of multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes based on a dataset of medical diagnostic measurements. The goal is to identify the most effective model for classifying individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various medical features such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, and insulin levels. The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for machine learning model evaluation in the healthcare domain.
Installation

Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Different_models_on_diabetes_mohamedHesham.git

Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Different_models_on_diabetes_mohamedHesham
    
Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run the model comparisons and make predictions, execute the Different_models_on_diabetes_mohamedHesham.py script:
    python Different_models_on_diabetes_mohamedHesham.py

Ensure that the dataset is available in the appropriate directory or modify the script to point to the dataset's location.
Models

The project utilizes the following machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes:

    Decision Tree Classifier
    Logistic Regression
    Gradient Boosting Classifier
    Random Forest Classifier

Each model is evaluated to determine the most accurate and reliable predictor for diabetes.
Results

The results of the model comparisons, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, are provided in the script's output. These metrics help assess each model's performance and suitability for diabetes prediction.
